# LPM-Assignment-ECON-8710
The code I used to complete an assignment for my Data Analytics for Economics class. The goal was to create a Linear Probability Model for predicting which party a voter will choose in Presidential elections. I have attached a pdf of my R file, the Python Code to produce my dataset, the original dataset, and a pdf of the assignment.
